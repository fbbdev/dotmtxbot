# dotmtxbot

This is the code of a Telegram bot that can be invoked inline (that is while typing a message,
like _@gif_ and _@pic_) to generate scrolling dot matrix display GIFs with some text, which
then you can send to the current chat.

It is written in Go and has the ffmpeg command as a dependency.
